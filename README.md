# FaraRotation
Arduino and Nextion controlling the polarization angles of RX and TX EME antennas, to align with Faraday rotation.

If you landed to this repository and you are reading this file, very likely you know what EME, 432MHz, Spatial Offset, and Faraday rotation are.
The documentation for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/I8NHJ/FaraRotation/wiki)

FaraRotation is distributed under the MIT license.
If you use, modify, and distribute the code, please do not delete the references to my call both in the code and in the documentation.
It will be much appreciated.
