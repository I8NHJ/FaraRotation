# FaraRotation
Arduino and Nextion controlling the polarization angles of RX and TX EME antennas, to align with Faraday rotation.

If you landed to this repository and you are reading this file, very likely you know what EME, 432MHz, Spatial Offset, and Faraday rotation are.
The documentation for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/I8NHJ/FaraRotation/wiki)

# Acknowledgements
FaraRotation has been inspired by [K3NG rotor controller](https://github.com/k3ng/k3ng_rotator_controller). Thank you, Anthony, for your masterpiece.

Thank you to the [WSJT-X](https://wsjt.sourceforge.io/wsjtx.html) people who made the moon libraries available to the public.
