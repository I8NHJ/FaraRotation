# FaraRotation
Arduino and Nextion controlling the polarization angles of RX and TX EME antennas, to align with Faraday rotation.

If you landed to this repository and you are reading this file, very likely you know what EME, 432MHz, Spatial Offset, and Faraday rotation are.
The documentation for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/I8NHJ/FaraRotation/wiki)
